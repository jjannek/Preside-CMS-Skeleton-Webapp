A skeleton PresideCMS application to be used as a starting point for web applications that are purely admin based (no front-end CMS elements).

### Important

This package should be installed using the `preside new site` command from CommandBox rather than directly. See [PresideCMS Commands](https://www.forgebox.io/view/preside-commands).
